Process
Design API
You want to develop a quick API that helps you with design questions. Your API should be
able to:
• Return the complementary color of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple
Project
You should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Spring Boot). The service should
be able to return the desired information using REST.

Requirements
Use GitHub or Azure DevOps for the project and follow the correct DevOps procedure. Use a Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model (preferable
Git flow) to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban
board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration
pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well.
Document
• the whole process
• the user stories
• the repository URL
• the usage of the software
in a README file with explanatory text. Submit the code (including the .git folder and ALM
files) as a zip file (please put the README inside the zip file).
You can use external resources as long as you mark them: “ // taken from: <URL> ”
